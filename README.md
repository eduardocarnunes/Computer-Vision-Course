# Course Computer Vision OpenCV in Python with Deep Learning

### What I have learned in the course:
  - Understand and use OpenCV4 in Python
  - Create Face Detectors & Recognizers and create your own advanced face swaps using DLIB
  - Learned to build simple Image Classifiers in Python
  - Learned to Perform Neural Style Transfer Using OpenCV
  - Learned how to convert black and white Images to color using Caffe
  - Learned the Basics of Computer Vision and Image Processing
  - How to use Deep Learning using Keras & TensorFlow in Python
  - Object Detection, Tracking and Motion Analysis
  - Programming skills such as basic Python and Numpy
  - Understand Neural and Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Learned to build an OCR Reader for Credit Cards
  - Learned how to do Multi Object Detection in OpenCV using SSDs (Single Shot Detector)
  - Learned to build an Automatic Number (License) Plate Recognition (ALPR)

### Requirements
 - Little to no programming knowledge is needed, but basic programing knowledge will help
 - Windows 10 or Ubuntu or a MacOS system
 - A webcam to implement some of the mini projects
